## Blotto Game

# Description
The Blotto Game (Colonel Blotto game) is a type of constant-sum game in which players must simultaneously distribute limited resources over several objects (battlefields), where that battlefield is won by allocating more resources.

The description of this specific game is as follows:

You and another (equally qualified) candidate are running for office. There are 10 districts, numbered 1, 2, 3, …, 10 and each is worth 1 vote. You have 100 discrete units of resources (e.g. time, campaign workers), which you can allocate between the districts however you wish. Your opponent independently does the same.

District N will award its vote to a candidate if and only if that candidate spends strictly more than N times the resources as their opponent (for N = 1, 2, 3, …, 10).

# Objective
You get one entry, and the final score is the average number of districts won playing head-to-head against each other participant in a pool with a few hundred applicants.
